## Pascal Case for Usual Texts

## README

Have you ever heard of the Camel case? Camel case and Pascal case both are the same naming convention. If you don&#8217;t know pascal case means capitalizing the first alphabet of every word of your text. E.g. This Is A Example Of A Text Using Pascal Case.

It&#8217;s a very common standard for programming languages but this project is not for naming your variable! It&#8217;s for usual texts we use in our daily life which has space (&#8221; &#8220;) in between words!

Now that you know what this project does, probably you are thinking this project is very silly. But if you are dealing with a huge chunk of data and have to use this naming convention for each word, that can be a huge pain!

I made this project while I was working on a work project, which required populating data on a web database and needed to use this naming convention for more than 300+ pages! So why not solve a real-life problem with the automation skill I have! The surprising thing is only because of these few lines of code, I completed the project on time.
