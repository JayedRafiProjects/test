## Software Development

## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## README

Hey! Thanks for taking the time for checking out this project! This project helps to understand the process happening inside sorting algorithms! I found computer science &#8211; algorithm courses at most universities cover sorting algorithms. So it&#8217;s important to understand how these algorithms work! And a visual representation of what is happening inside can be a good source for grasping the concept.

This program visualizes each step separately to compare and evaluate with previous and next steps. An interesting fact, it doesn&#8217;t use any data visualization library or GUI to show the steps as a chat, instead, it creates the column charts using a function! And this thing is the creative part of this project. It can be a good learning experience for someone who thinks it&#8217;s not possible to visualize data, just because of not knowing how to use GUI.

**Included sorting algorithms:** Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Merge sort and Quicksort. 

**Some implication fields:**  Education and Data Visualization

**Associated language and technologies:** JAVA

**Report:** Download the program from the associated <a href="https://github.com/JayedRafiProjects/sorting_algorithm_visualizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> account and read the **report** for more detailed information.
