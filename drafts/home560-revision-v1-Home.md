###### About me

### I am a Developer based on Winnipeg

### &#8230; Design  
Create &#8230;  
&#8230; Execute  


Hey there! Thanks for stopping by my portfolio. I am ambitious and experienced in web and software development with 2+ years of experience.

Currently, I am pursuing my bachelor&#8217;s degree in Computer Science at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manitoba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Manitoba</a>. I have found my interest in computational algorithms and software development. Still exploring new branches and it makes me fascinated!

I have worked on many work and personal projects which may give you a glimpse of my expertise in those fields. In general, you will find most of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/JayedRafiProjects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, but there are some work projects that I have done / currently working on which are not permitted to share publicly so I apologize for that. But if you want to know about those projects, you can email and I would love to share my experience with you!

Besides all these, I have an interest in graphics design (see my Design Portfolio) and trying to learn [origami](https://jayedrafi.com/origami/).

I love working with projects !! I usually don&#8217;t have many things to do whenever I am free. If you need any help on your project or want me to join your project ( If you think I am the best fit for your mind-blowing project! ), please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me.

Again thanks for stopping by my portfolio. I appreciate your time! ðŸ™‚Â
